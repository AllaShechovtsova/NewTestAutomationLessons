A licensing agreement is a legal contract between two parties, known as the licensor
 and the licensee. In a typical licensing agreement, the licensor grants the licensee 
 the right to produce and sell goods, apply a brand name or trademark, or use patented 
 technology owned by the licensor. In exchange, the licensee usually submits to a series 
 of conditions regarding the use of the licensor's property and agrees to make payments  known as royalties.
Licensing agreements cover a wide range of well-known situations. For example, a retailer
 might reach agreement with a professional sports team to develop, produce, and sell merchandise 
 bearing the sports team's logo. Or a small manufacturer might license a proprietary 
 production technology from a larger firm to gain a competitive edge rather than expending 
 the time and money trying to develop its own technology. Or a greeting card company might reach
 agreement with a movie distributor to produce a line of greeting cards bearing the image of a popular 
 animated character.
